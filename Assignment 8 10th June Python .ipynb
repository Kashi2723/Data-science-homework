    "arguments and keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, we can pass arguments to a function in two main ways: positional arguments and keyword arguments.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Positional Arguments:These are the most common type of arguments. They are passed to a function \n",
    "in the order in which the parameters are defined. The values you provide are assigned to the \n",
    "parameters based on their position.\n",
    "For ex : def add(x,y):\n",
    "            print(x+y)\n",
    "    Calling a function:\n",
    "    add(3,5)\n",
    "    it will print \"8\" as answer, and in this 3 is assigned to 'x' \n",
    "    and 5 is assigned to 'y' based on their position.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Keyword arguments: With keyword arguments, we explicitly mention the parameter \n",
    "names along with the values. This allows you to pass values in a different order \n",
    "or skip certain parameters.\n",
    "For ex : def greet(name,message):\n",
    "            print(\"Hello\",name,message)\n",
    "    Calling a function:\n",
    "    greet(message= \"Good morning\", name = \"Kashish\"),\n",
    "    It will print \"Hello Kashish Good morning\", and as in this,\n",
    "    the values are assigned as per the parameters names, rather than their\n",
    "    positions, and so these are keyword arguments."

    "# 3. What is the purpose of the return statement in a function? Can a function have multiple return\n",
    "statements? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The return statement in a function serves the purpose of ending the function's execution and sending a value back to the caller. \n",
    "It allows a function to produce a result that can be used in the rest of the program. When a return statement is encountered, \n",
    "the function immediately exits, and the specified value (if any) is returned to the calling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can have multiple return statements, but only one of them will be executed. \n",
    "The choice of which return statement to execute depends on certain conditions or logic within the function. \n",
    "Once a return statement is executed, the function exits, and the program flow returns to the point where the function was called.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ex: def get_grade(score):\n",

    "# 4. What are lambda functions in Python? How are they different from regular functions? Provide an\n",
    "example where a lambda function can be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Lambda functions in Python are a way to create small, anonymous, and inline functions. They are also known as anonymous functions \n",
    "because they don't have a name. Lambda functions are defined using the lambda keyword, followed by the function parameters and an expression. \n",

    "\n",
    "Ans. If we want to return more than one thing from a function in Python, we can use the return statement with multiple values packed into a tuple. \n",
    "A tuple is like a group of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ex: def get_values():\n",
    "    value1 = 10\n",
    "    value2 = \"Hello\"\n",
