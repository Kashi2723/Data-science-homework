    "Ans. Log levels in Python logging represent the severity or importance of log messages. The logging module provides several predefined log levels, each serving a specific purpose. \n",

    "2. INFO: Use to provide general information about the application's state, startup, or key processes.\n",
    "3. WARNING: Use for non-critical issues that need attention but won't stop the program from running. For example, a deprecated feature usage.\n",
    "4. ERROR: Use for significant errors that affect the program's behavior but allow it to continue running. For example, a failed database connection.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python logging, a log formatter is a way to control how log messages are presented. It defines the structure of log entries, including elements like timestamp, log level, and message. we can customize the appearance of log messages using placeholders \n",
    "like %(asctime)s for the timestamp or %(levelname)s for the log level. If the default formatting doesn't suit our needs, we can create a custom formatter by subclassing the Formatter class and defining our own format method. \n",
